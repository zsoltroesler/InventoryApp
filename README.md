**Project #10: Inventory app**

Project overview: The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its 
inventory of products. The app needs to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. 
It also needs to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.
This project is about combining various ideas and skills learnt throughout the course. They include: 
 - Storing information in a SQLite database
 - Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
 - Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
 - Updating information based on user input.
 - Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
